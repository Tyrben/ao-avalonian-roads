## Coder point of view
If you disagree with the project, the language or the architecture... you can choose to change it (we are available), or to create your own project.

If you want to participate to the project in it's current state, the best option is to pull your own copy and begin to change it. The merge should be done via a Pull Request were we will be able to review the code, estimate the risks, agree or disagree, and finaly merge it.

### C++
The current base of code is written in C\++17. We are no expert of this language. There are always a possibility to make it better. If you know it, fill free to rewrite portions of code to a more C\++17 way.

The evolution to C++20 is possible, but have in mind we would like to stake compatible with at least Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and Windows Visual Studio 2019.

### CMake
The current base of code is built around Modern CMake 3 in its revision 3.9. We are no expert of this build system. Fill free to rewrite portions of code.

The project should always be able to build and compile under linux and windows.

### Design
The separation of concerns is a way of achieving proper code. Make the retakes it needs, use the design patterns as tools, not as a goal, but use it.

### Architecture
This project (gps) alone is too small to have an architecture. But you can see in the main documentation, this gps tool is part of a larger software suite which has an architecture.

It was ment to can evolve, to be replaced...

## Non coder point of view
A project always need other expertise than software development. The documentation, for example is a critical aspect. The promotion of the project and his capacity to be used widely is crucial.

Fill free to offer any adjustment, or to build up any outside element needed to make this project grow.
