## Coding

Free to you to participate to this project, to agree or disagree on the language or the architecture... you can choose to change it (we are available), or to create your own project.

If you want to participate to this project in it's current state, the best option is to pull your own copy and begin to change it. A merge should be done via a Pull Request were we will be able to review the code, estimate the risks and finaly merge it.

### C++
The choice of C\++ was a question of available skills. But it can be transposed to any other ecosystem.

The current base of code is written in C\++17. We are no expert of this language, there is always a possibility to make it better. If you know it, fill free to rewrite portions of code to a more C\++17 way.

The evolution to C\++20 is possible, but have in mind we would like to stake compatible with at least Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and Windows Visual Studio 2019.

### CMake
The current base of code is built around "More" Modern CMake 3 in its revision 3.13. We are no expert of this build system. Fill free to rewrite portions of code.

The project should always be able to build and compile under linux and windows.

### Design
The separation of concerns is a way of achieving proper code. Make the retakes it needs, use the design patterns as tools, not as a goal, but use it.

### Architecture
This project (gps) alone is too small to have an architecture. But you can see in the main documentation, this gps tool is part of a larger software suite which has an architecture.

It was ment to can evolve, to be replaced...


## Not coding
A project always need other expertise than software development. The documentation, for example is a critical aspect. The promotion of the project and his capacity to be used widely is crucial.

Fill free to offer any adjustment, or to build up any outside element needed to make this project grow.

### Documentation - Promotion
This project is born in a small guild between few persons. It responds to some needs, but it was tought with a capacity of expansion and genericity.

Up to you to speak of this project around you, to fix our documentations, or to fork this project.

### Feedback
The Github issue system allows you to participate. You can write end-user feedbacks, bug reports, expectations...

Or write in-code reviews, remarks, retake proposals...
